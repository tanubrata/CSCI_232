# CSCI_232

This is the Hunter College SQL course of Spring 2019 taught by Prof. Di He.
All of the homeworks questions were given by him. It was a very hard course
and needed much time to write the codes so don't plagiarize, use it as a refernece only.
These codes are for education purpose only and if used, do not forget to give the credits!
