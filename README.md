# CSCI_232

This is the Hunter College SQL course of Spring 2019 taught by Prof. Di He.
All of the homeworks questions were given by him. It was a very hard course
and needed much time to write the codes so don't plagiarize. These codes are 
for education purpose only and if used, do not forget to give the credits!
